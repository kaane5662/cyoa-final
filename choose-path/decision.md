# **Choose Your Path**

## You have succesfully reached the roof without being seen or setting off the alarms. You have stumbled upon two ways to get inside the club, the emergency stairs or the vent. Going through the vent will have a more likeley chance of you not being seen since no one usually is around there. The emergency stairs are public so there may be some sort of security there. So now choose. 

## _Path 1_

### [Go Through Vent](../quest-complete/complete.md)

## _Path 2_
