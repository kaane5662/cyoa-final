# "So you accepted a quest to protect our Queen?"
### Although they seem shady you follow them to an old mansion.
### It seems as though the woods are very dense with trees as tall as the mansion itself.
### You meet the queen in the living quarters, tense about the situation of people trying to kill someone.
### "Hello Sir, It seems as though a group by the name of the watchers are trying to kill me. 
### One of our scouts have snuck in but I doubt he will last long."
## It seems as though there are two options to chose from.
## Hide the queen in the [Throne Room](../throne/throne-room.md)
# Or
## Hide the queen in the [Woods](../woods/ambush.md)
