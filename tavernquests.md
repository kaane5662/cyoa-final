# Walking into the tavern.
### Sitting down at the table chilling, counting the money you made from your last quest
### Two papers sit in front of you
### "Hey kid, I need some help from you."
### One's a protection quest, not a lot of information is told about it other then a rumor about a group named the watchers
### The other is a killing quest, trying to kill a queen in the darkness of night at the club
## Which shall you choose?
## [Assassin quest](assassin-quest/assasin.md)
# Or
## [Bodyguard quest](bodyguard/mansion.md)
